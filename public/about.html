<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and hardworking basketball player from Georgia, striving to make my mark in the United States.
   As a skilled shooting guard, I take pride in my three-point shooting, with my signature step-back and hesitation pull-up moves 
   catching defenders off guard. I push myself daily, making thousands of shots each week to perfect my craft and elevate my game. 
   Beyond basketball, I am focused on building a future in tech, learning programming, and exploring freelancing opportunities. 
   My goal is to balance basketball, education, and financial independence, proving that I can succeed in multiple areas of life.

<p>Off the court, I have a deep appreciation for music, especially classic crooner-style songs and jazz. 
  I also enjoy learning about whiskey and expanding my knowledge of different styles and flavors. 
  My journey is one of perseverance, much like the movies I relate to, such as Whiplash and 8 Mile. 
  While chasing my basketball dreams, I navigate relationships and personal growth, always looking for ways to improve myself. 
  With the support of my family and a strong mindset, I am determined to make the most of every opportunity 
  and prove myself on and off the court.</p>
